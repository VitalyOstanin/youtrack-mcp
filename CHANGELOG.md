### Changed

- Documentation: Verified and aligned README.md and README-ru.md TOCs according to AGENTS.md and README-release.md requirements

## [0.7.1] - 2025-10-23

### Added

- Issues: Introduced `issues_list` and `issues_count` MCP tools for paginated listings and per-project totals with comprehensive filtering and sorting controls
- Query builder: Added `buildIssueQuery` utility to generate consistent search filters with project resolution support

### Changed

- Types & client: Expanded issue-related types and YouTrack client methods to surface pagination metadata and per-project counts
- Documentation: Updated README (EN/RU) tool tables with new listing/counting capabilities and clarified usage guidance

## [0.7.0] - 2025-10-21

- Documentation: Added "Issue Links" section to README files describing new tooling and usage guidance

## [0.6.0] - 2025-10-21

### Added

## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-18

### Added

- **Issue starring** - Star/unstar issues to mark important items:
  - `issue_star`: Add star to issue for current user (idempotent operation)
  - `issue_unstar`: Remove star from issue for current user (idempotent operation)
  - `issues_star_batch`: Batch starring up to 50 issues with concurrency control
  - `issues_unstar_batch`: Batch unstarring up to 50 issues with concurrency control
  - `issues_starred_list`: Get all starred issues with pagination (default 50, max 200)
  - New field `watchers(hasStar)` in all issue responses to indicate star status
- **Concurrency control** - Efficient batch operation processing:
  - Added `@vitalyostanin/mutex-pool` dependency for managing concurrent API requests
  - Implemented `processBatch` helper method with configurable concurrency limit (default: 10)
  - Prevents API overload and timeout issues in batch operations
  - Applied to all batch tools: comments fetching, issue lookups, starring operations

### Changed

- Refactored all batch operations to use MutexPool for concurrency limiting:
  - `issues_comments`: Now processes up to 10 issues concurrently instead of unlimited
  - `issues_lookup`: Limited to 10 concurrent requests for better stability
  - `issues_details`: Controlled concurrency prevents API rate limiting
- Enhanced issue field definitions with array-based formatting for better maintainability
- Improved code organization with consistent result handling patterns

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-17

### Added

- **Compact mode configuration** - `YOUTRACK_COMPACT_MODE` environment variable:

  - Improves performance and reduces token usage in Claude Code

### Changed

  - Returns information about previous state, new state, and transition used
