# Repository Guidelines

## Contributor Notes
- Keep source code, comments, documentation, and commit messages in English.
- Run `npm run build` and `npx eslint .` before publishing changes to ensure type-checking and linting stay green.
- When formatting or refactoring code, default to running `npx eslint --fix` (without dry-run) so lintable issues are auto-corrected early.
- Maintain `README.md` in English and `README-ru.md` in Russian so both stay aligned with the YouTrack MCP feature set.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: TypeScript sources for the MCP server, YouTrack client, and tool registrations.
- `dist/`: Compiled JavaScript emitted by `npm run build` (ignored by git).
- `index.ts`: Entry point that wires the stdio transport to the server.

## Build & Development Commands
- `npm run build`: Compile TypeScript to `dist/`.
- `npm run dev`: Watch mode for local development (`tsc --watch`).
- `npx eslint --print-config <file>`: Dry-run lint config inspection (first run rule).
- After modifying `package.json` dependencies, always run `npm install` to update `package-lock.json` accordingly.
- Keep documentation (`README*`, `TODO*`, ru variants when available) aligned with the current YouTrack feature set after each iteration.

## Coding Style & Tooling
- Project uses TypeScript + ESLint (flat config). Follow the automated lint checks; avoid disabling rules without discussion.
- Prefer modern ES/TypeScript features (`const`, optional chaining, nullish coalescing, async/await).
- Keep TypeScript types strict: no `any`, prefer precise interfaces.

## MCP Response Format for Claude Code
- Claude Code reads data from the MCP `content` field, so every tool response must serialize its payload there.
- The `content` array should include at least one `text` item containing the JSON stringified payload for compatibility.
- Continue providing `structuredContent` for richer clients, but never rely on it alone.
- Use `toolSuccess` in `src/utils/tool-response.ts` to ensure both `content` and `structuredContent` are populated consistently.

## MCP Tooling Expectations
- Implement pagination for every MCP tool that may return large result sets; every tool must expose explicit pagination parameters and defaults in the schema.
- Use conservative defaults (â‰¤100 items per page unless the YouTrack API enforces a different limit) and document maximum supported sizes.

## MCP Tool Descriptions & Documentation
- **All MCP tool descriptions must include usage hints** to help users understand when and how to use each tool effectively.
- Each tool description should contain:
  - **Purpose**: Brief explanation of what the tool does (1-2 sentences).
  - **Use cases**: Bulleted list of typical scenarios where the tool is useful (e.g., "Use for: Browsing available issues, Searching issues by user activity").
  - **Parameter examples**: Concrete examples of parameter values in parameter descriptions (e.g., "Filter by state (e.g., 'opened', 'closed')").
  - **Response field explanations**: Key fields returned and their meaning, especially for non-obvious fields.
  - **Limitations**: Any constraints or edge cases users should be aware of (e.g., "max 50 issues per request").
- Keep descriptions concise but informative; prioritize clarity over brevity when it helps prevent common mistakes.
- Update tool descriptions whenever adding new parameters or changing behavior.

## Build Artifacts
- Only `dist/` should contain compiled assets; do not commit build output.
